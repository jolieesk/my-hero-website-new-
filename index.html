  <h2 class="title">Why I chose my mom?</h2>
</article>
<!--paragrapgh-->

<p class="why"> I chose my mom because she was always the one giving me advices and being there for me to talk whenever I needed her.
My mom's always been my best friend and we always told each other everything no matter what it was.
She made a great impact on my life, I always looked up to her as I grew up and I'm so much like her.
She taught a lot of different stuff and what to do when anything happens and she would always spend hours with me on whatever I needed from her.
She always made sure I get everything right even if I failed the first time. She gave me confidence and made me a better person as I gew up and she still has a huge impact on me!

<p class="new"> Ever since I was born I always went out with my mom, I never let her go anywhere alone or in other words "without me" ;)
  She always made sure I'm okay and I'm just like her in everything, as soon as I started growing up we started to get closer everyday and it got better everyday we did.
  We started telling each other secrets and stuff I never thought I could talk to with my mom I always thought I would be closer to my friends but my mom is just like my best friend now.
  It's always been awesome from going shopping, to traveling, to making inside jokes, to understanding what the other person wants to say by just looking at each other.
